-- 2. Write a query to to find all employees whose last name starts and ends with 'E'. Use concat() to combine their first and last name together as a single column named full_name.
SELECT concat(first_name, last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE "E%E";
-- 3. Convert the names produced in your last query to all uppercase.
SELECT upper(concat(first_name, last_name)) AS full_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE "E%E";
-- 4. Use a function to determine how many results were returned from your previous query.
SELECT count(last_name)
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE "E%E";

Use datediff() function to find how many days they have been 
working at the company (Hint: You will also need to use NOW() or CURDATE()),

7. Use your knowledge of built in SQL functions to generate a username 
for all of the employees. A username should be all lowercase, 
and consist of the first character of the employees first name, 
the first 4 characters of the employees last name, an underscore, 
the month the employee was born, and the last two digits of the year 
that they were born. Below is an example of what the first 10 rows will look like:
